**Introduction**

Trains in India are the most significant means of the transportation system as well as the greatest source of earning for the economy. The railway system in India serves as the fundamental mode of transportation, linking urban centers and rural communities throughout the vast country. Indian Railways is considered one of the globe's most prominent railway networks, boasting an extensive train network. [The Indian Railways](https://indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/stat_econ/2023/PDF%20Year%20Book%202021-22-English.pdf) has a total running track length of **1,02,831 kilometers** and it operates **13,215 trains** (including steam, diesel, and electric engines) that transport over **9.64 million passengers each day** , comparable to transferring the whole population of Australia, and connects over 7,172 stops. The railway industry in India has a noteworthy influence on the economy by generating employment opportunities both directly and indirectly. The direct jobs come from train operations, maintenance, ticketing, catering, and related services. In addition to this, the railway industry supports other businesses such as manufacturing, construction, and tourism leading to economic expansion. Moreover, by promoting efficient train transit, the railway sector contributes to supply chain management thereby aiding trade and commerce throughout the country.

**History of Trains in India**

During the mid-nineteenth century, trains were introduced in India under the British colonial era. The [Indian Railways](https://indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,261#:~:text=The%20first%20railway%20on%20Indian,visit%20to%20Bhandup%20in%201843.) began operations on April 16, 1853, with the inaugural journey of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway (GIPR) between Bombay (now Mumbai) and Thane, spanning a distance of 34 kilometers. This historic event marked the commencement of railway services in India and paved the way for the development of the country's railway network.At the conclusion of the nineteenth century, a significant number of primary urban centers located in diverse regions of India were interlinked through railway systems, encompassing Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta), Chennai (formerly known as Madras) and Delhi. The British authority formed a single entity called Indian Railways by putting together various railway companies operating in India, later Indian Railways became the largest railway system in the world. After the independence in 1947, Indian railways became a nationalized entity under the Indian Government. Later, huge investments were for the advancement and expansion of the railway system. Many technological advancements were made such as online reservation system, modern signaling, etc.

**Train Accidents in India**

In India, train accidents remain a persistent concern as they result in loss of life, injuries, and damage to infrastructure. The causes of such accidents are diverse and include human error, technical malfunctions, track-related problems, and natural disasters. For the past few years, trains are not being trusted as a safe means of transport because of the nonstop occurrence of accidents. On November 28, 1854, the first recorded train accident in India occurred. The incident occurred near the Chintadripet Bridge in Chennai (then Madras) during the early days of the country's railway operations. The train in question was a passenger train that derailed while crossing the bridge, killing several passengers and injuring many more. And it was just the start, India witnessed a lot of major train accidents over time which took the lives and the trust of a lot of people and also damaged the infrastructure of the country. Firozabad Train Accident (1981): On August 20, 1981, two express trains, the Avadh-Assam Express and the Brahmaputra Mail, collided head-on in Firozabad in Uttar Pradesh. Over 100 individuals were killed in the tragedy, and many more were injured, **Reason –** a combination of signalling errors and miscommunication. The Rajdhani Express derailed while crossing a bridge near Rafiganj in Bihar on September 10, 2002, forcing many carriages to tumble into the Dhave River. Approximately 130 passengers were killed in the crash. **Reason -** A section of the rail track failed, causing the carriages to plunge into the river. And the most recent breathtaking accident in the history of train accidents in India which happened on 2nd June, 2023 in Balasore district, Odisha. The collision occurred when the Coromandel Express 12841 deviated from the main line and entered the passing loop near Bahanaga Bazar railway station at full speed, resulting in a collision with a cargo train. The Coromandel Express was scheduled to go straight to its destination, in spite of this, the vehicle quickly switched to the parallel route and crashed with the cargo train, causing the train to crash and resulting in the loss of human life in this disaster.

**What were the emergency responses to this disaster?**

A helpline number has been established by the Indian Railways and the governments of Odisha, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu. The National Disaster Action Force, Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force, and 15 additional rescue teams, as well as over 200 doctors and nurses, were dispatched to the scene. More than 200 ambulances and municipal buses were dispatched to the scene to quickly transport the injured to the nearest hospitals. The search for the injured and trapped passengers lasted all night on June 2nd and finished in the afternoon on June 3rd. Approximately 300 people died on the spot as a result of this terrible accident, and another 800 were injured.

**Legal Provisions for train accidents in India**

- **The Railways Act, 1989:** [The Railways Act](https://iritm.indianrailways.gov.in/instt/uploads/files/1436340449446-Railways%20Act%201989.pdf) is a large piece of legislation that governs many aspects of Indian railway operations. It includes legislation governing railway passenger safety, accident prevention, and the railway administration's responsibilities in the event of an accident or incident.

[**Section 123 of the Railway Act of 1989**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1023544/#:~:text=(iii)%20a%20minor%20child%20of,dependant%20on%20the%20deceased%20passenger.)addresses "Accidents and Inquiries".

5. **Appeal Process:** This would most likely detail the requirements for submitting appeals against Claims Tribunal rulings, such as the time limit, method, and higher authorities to whom appeals should be filed.

- **The Railway Claims Tribunal Act, 1987:** [The Railway Claims Tribunal Act](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1771?sam_handle=123456789/1362) creates special tribunals to handle claims relating to train accidents and other unpleasant situations. The Railway Claims Tribunal has the authority to hear and adjudicate compensation claims and other relevant concerns.

Any mishap or misfortune in the operation of a railway involving a passenger train or a portion thereof that results in the death or physical harm of a passenger travelling therein during his rail voyage is considered an accident under [**Section 82A**](https://indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/traffic_comm/RCT%20ACT%201987.pdf).

- **IPC (Indian Penal Code):**[The IPC](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/2263?sam_handle=123456789/1362) has provisions for criminal offences concerning railroad accidents, such as causing death by negligence **(Section 304A).**, endangering the safety of individuals travelling by railway **(Section 336)**, and mischief causing damage to railway property **(Section 150)**. Individuals found guilty of such offences face penalties under these rules.

1. **Section 304A:** [**Causing death by negligence**](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/show-data?actid=AC_CEN_5_23_00037_186045_1523266765688&orderno=341#:~:text=Causing%20death%20by%20negligence.%2D%2D,fine%2C%20or%20with%20both.%5D) **:** _ **"** __Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both"._

- **The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988:** The Act is largely concerned with motor vehicle and road traffic control in India.It does not have specific sections relating to train accidents since trains are not considered motor vehicles under this act. Trains are governed by separate legislation, namely the Railways Act, 1989, which is specifically designed to address issues related to railways, including train accidents.

It is important to note, however, that the [Motor Vehicles Act of 1988](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1798?sam_handle=123456789/1362) may apply in some cases involving train accidents. For example, if a train collides with a motor vehicle at a level crossing or if a road traffic accident occurs at a railway crossing involving a vehicle and a train, the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act may be used to determine liability or compensation.

In such cases,the following parts of the Motor Vehicles Act may be applicable:

1. [**Section 131**](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/9460/1/a1988-59.pdf) **:** _"Duty of the driver to take certain precautions at unguarded railway level crossing"._
2. [**Section 134**](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/9460/1/a1988-59.pdf) **:** _"Duty of driver in case of accident and injury to a person"._

**Conclusion**

To conclude, the railways in India serve as a crucial mode of transportation, connecting both urban and rural regions throughout the nation.The Indian Railways, which is recognised as one of the world's leading railway networks, plays an important role in stimulating the economy by creating jobs and providing assistance to a variety of businesses. Nevertheless, train accidents persist as a worrisome issue, leading to loss of life, injuries, and harm to infrastructure. In India, the approach to addressing railroad accidents involves a multifaceted strategy.Immediate support is available through helpline numbers, and national and state disaster response forces, as well as local rescue squads, conduct rescue operations. The deployment of medical staff aims to provide immediate aid to the injured, while efforts are made to identify and rescue individuals who are stranded.

The Railways Act, Railway Accident and Untoward Incident (Compensation) Rules, Railway Claims Tribunal Act, and Indian Penal Code establish principles for accident prevention, victim compensation, and the investigation and prosecution of those involved. The Motor Vehicles Act may also apply in some situations involving railroad accidents involving motor vehicles.

Although there are existing procedures in place to address train accidents and their subsequent consequences, additional endeavors are required to enhance safety, upgrade infrastructure, and mitigate the hazards associated with train travel in India.
